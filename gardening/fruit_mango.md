- Should be as big as possible for best chance of ripening & taste. THis experience is gained by buying over a season
- All types ripe criteria. If unsure:
        - smell and then peel one fruit. If not sweet, wait for next day, peel another etc.
        - WHen right, softness & smell, pick all similar ones and eat that day

    - When peeled, the inside should be as (or even more) yellow as the skin. i.e. cannot distinguish between skin and flesh.
