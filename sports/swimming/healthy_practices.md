 
**PRACTICE REMINDERS**




**WE APPRECIATE OUR PARENTS**

Thank you to all the parents for making summer swim team a memorable experience. We appreciate you encouraging swimmers to be at practice. We realize May is challenging with end of year performances and exams. Thank you for making sure swimmers come prepared every day. Your help with taking care of team equipment and watching out for the safety of others is greatly appreciated. It takes a village and we are glad to have all of you part of ours. Don’t miss out on Friday evenings happy hour during May. Parents enjoy coming up to the pool to visit and share snacks as the school year wraps up.




**COME PREPARED TO EVERY PRACTICE**

Wear a well-fitting swimsuit. Use high quality goggles that don’t leak and fit properly. Secure hair in a silicone swimming cap. Apply sunscreen before practice starts. Always bring a water bottle, there is also a water fountain in the clubhouse to refill it if needed to prevent swimmers from getting dehydrated. Don’t forget at towel. A common injury we see around the pool is stubbed toes. Avoid heavy food until after swimming as vomit in the pool ends practice for everyone! If a swimmer feels like their tummy is unhappy, they should exit the pool immediately.



**TAKE CARE OF TEAM EQUIPMENT**

The team purchases and owns the pool ropes. Parents, please help remind swimmers not to hang on them as it stretches them out and damages the hooks. Younger swimmers will be placed in outside lanes near a wall. Lane ropes will be removed from the pool and stored on the reel after every practice. Please remind swimmers to be kind to team kickboards by not surfing on them or using them to hit other swimmers. All kickboards and equipment should be returned to the basket at the end of practice and locked in the closet. Swimmers should not enter the equipment closet or storage shed unless asked by a coach or team leader.



**NEED EXTRA PRACTICE?**

Does your swimmer need a little extra practice? If so, Coaches Abby, Kate and Elena are available for private lessons. Sign up information is available on the table by the wading pool. Swim Team volunteers (and coaches only after practice) can answer any questions about lessons.

**IS YOUR SWIMMER PRONE TO EAR INFECTIONS?**

If your swimmer is prone to ear infections, consider using ear plugs and a Swimmer’s Ear solution after exiting the water (1 part white vinegar to 1 part rubbing alcohol). We want to avoid missed practice time due to ear infections.

**PREVENT CHLORINE DAMAGED HAIR**

Dry, brittle, green hair is no fun during swim season. Saturate hair with clean tap water prior to entering the pool so it doesn’t absorb as much chlorine. Apply a leave in conditioner or coconut oil to hair. Wear a swim cap. Swim caps not only help swimmers move faster in the water, but they reduce chlorine exposure. Rinse with clean water after swimming. Wash hair with 1-part Apple Cider Vinegar and 4-parts water or use a swimming shampoo that removes chlorine and other oxidized metals. Condition hair well.

**DON’T MISS OUT ON TEAM COMMUNICATIONS**

Weather delays and important announcements will be communicated through Remind texts.
