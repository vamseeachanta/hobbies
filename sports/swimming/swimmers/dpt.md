## Visualizations - Begginers

The recommended visualize during the day before entering the pool.

Recommended ones are:
- Floating without stress of sinking down
- Kicking strongly with legs coming all the way to water surface.
- visualize daily practice assignments before entering the pool 
- Add more as you see fit

## Recommended videos

Send what you prefer. I will add them here. This is your home assignment.

## Equipment Readiness

Season 1 is basics and getting all equipment needed.

- Right googles. Try Arjuns. So we can buy more next year at Costco.
- Got to SwimOutlet.com. Buy equipment now for next year. If you do no spend now, there is less chance you will enter pool next year.
- Buy swim robe for privacy, dryness, change-out etc. 
- Buy good beach towel
