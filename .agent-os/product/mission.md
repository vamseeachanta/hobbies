## Pitch

Hobbies Knowledge Repository is a comprehensive personal knowledge management system that helps individuals and families organize, document, and share learning experiences across multiple life interests and activities. By providing structured documentation and resources for hobbies ranging from sports and gardening to software development and cultural activities, it serves as both a personal learning portfolio and a valuable shared resource for family members and community groups.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Individual Knowledge Seekers**: People who want to systematically organize and track their learning across multiple hobbies and interests
- **Family Units**: Families looking for shared resources and documentation for activities involving children with special needs

### User Personas

**Personal Knowledge Manager** (25-65 years old)
- **Role:** Parent, hobbyist, lifelong learner
- **Context:** Managing multiple interests and activities while supporting family members with diverse needs
- **Pain Points:** Scattered information across different sources, difficulty tracking progress, lack of organized reference materials
- **Goals:** Centralize knowledge, create reusable resources, build a learning legacy for family

**Community Resource Seeker** (20-50 years old)

- **Goals:** Access proven methods, save time on research, find inclusive activity approaches

## The Problem

### Scattered Knowledge Management

Personal learning experiences and hobby documentation are typically scattered across multiple platforms, making it difficult to build on previous knowledge or share insights with others. This fragmentation leads to repeated research efforts and lost valuable insights.

**Our Solution:** A centralized, well-organized repository that structures knowledge by hobby categories with consistent documentation patterns.

### Lack of Special Needs Considerations

Most hobby and activity resources don't consider the unique needs of individuals with autism or other special requirements, making it challenging for families to find appropriate guidance and inclusive approaches.

**Our Solution:** Integrated special needs considerations and autism-friendly resources across all activity areas.

### Community Knowledge Isolation

Individual families and hobbyists often work in isolation, recreating resources and learning paths that others have already developed, leading to duplicated effort and missed opportunities for shared learning.

**Our Solution:** A sharable resource structure that can benefit family members, community groups, and fellow hobbyists.

## Differentiators

### Integrated Special Needs Focus

Unlike general hobby websites or documentation systems, we integrate autism resources and special needs considerations directly into each hobby area. This results in more inclusive and accessible learning materials that serve diverse family needs.

### Multi-Generational Knowledge Repository

Unlike typical personal note-taking systems, we structure documentation to serve both personal reference and family/community sharing. This creates lasting value that extends beyond individual use to benefit multiple generations and community members.

### Cross-Hobby Learning Integration

Unlike single-topic resources, we maintain connections and learning patterns across diverse hobby areas from sports to software development. This enables cross-pollination of insights and holistic personal development tracking.
