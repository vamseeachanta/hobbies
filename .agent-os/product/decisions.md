## 2025-07-31: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Hobbies will be developed as a comprehensive personal development and recreational activity management system, focusing on family activity coordination, special needs support, and multi-domain activity organization across sports, arts, education, and therapeutic programs.

### Context

The system addresses the complex needs of modern families managing multiple activities, with particular attention to special needs coordination. The current file-based organization demonstrates the need for better structure and digital tools while maintaining the flexibility to support diverse activity types from sports to therapeutic programs.

### Rationale

The multi-domain approach recognizes that families, especially those with special needs individuals, require coordination across many different types of activities and providers. A unified system reduces fragmentation and improves coordination between activities, caregivers, and service providers.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Centralized management reduces complexity and lost information
- Special needs focus addresses underserved market segment
- Multi-activity approach provides comprehensive family solution
- File-based foundation allows gradual digital enhancement

**Negative:**
- Complex requirements across diverse activity domains
- Special needs compliance and privacy requirements
- Need for expertise in therapeutic and developmental programs
