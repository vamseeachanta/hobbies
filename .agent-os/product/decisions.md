## 2025-07-24: Initial Product Architecture and Philosophy

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner

### Decision

Adopt a file-based documentation system using markdown and supporting formats, organized by hobby categories, with git version control as the foundation for a personal knowledge management system focused on hobbies and family activities.

### Context

The need for a comprehensive yet simple system to organize learning materials across multiple hobby areas including sports, gardening, software development, cultural activities, and autism resources. The system must serve both personal knowledge management and family/community sharing while remaining accessible and maintainable.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Database-Driven CMS (WordPress, Drupal)**
   - Pros: Rich editing interface, built-in search, user management
   - Cons: Complex setup, hosting requirements, overkill for documentation needs

2. **Note-Taking Apps (Notion, Obsidian)**
   - Pros: Structured data, linking capabilities, modern interface
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, limited customization, export limitations

3. **Wiki Systems (MediaWiki, TiddlyWiki)**
   - Pros: Designed for knowledge management, linking, versioning
   - Cons: Complex for simple documentation, requires hosting/maintenance

### Rationale

The file-based markdown approach provides maximum flexibility, portability, and simplicity while avoiding vendor lock-in. Git integration ensures version control and backup. The system can evolve progressively without breaking existing content or requiring migration.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Complete control over content and presentation
- Easy backup and version control through git
- Platform-independent and future-proof
- Can evolve incrementally to add web presentation layer
- Low maintenance overhead
- Perfect for collaborative editing and family sharing

**Negative:**
- No built-in search functionality (initially)
- Requires technical knowledge for setup and maintenance
- Manual organization required
- Limited real-time collaboration features

## 2025-07-24: Special Needs Integration Philosophy

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Family Members

### Decision

Integrate autism resources and special needs considerations throughout all hobby documentation rather than segregating them into a separate section.

### Context

Family includes members with autism spectrum needs, requiring activity adaptations and specialized resources. Rather than treating these as separate concerns, they should be woven into each hobby area to promote inclusive participation.

### Rationale

Integrated approach ensures that special needs considerations are not afterthoughts but core parts of activity planning. This creates more comprehensive resources that benefit the entire family and could help other families with similar needs.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- More inclusive and comprehensive activity guides
- Reduced need to cross-reference between general and special needs resources
- Could serve as a model for other families
- Promotes holistic activity planning

**Negative:**
- Requires more detailed documentation for each activity
- May make some guides longer or more complex
- Requires ongoing maintenance to keep special needs information current

## 2025-07-24: Progressive Enhancement Technology Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner

### Decision

Maintain the current file-based structure as the foundation while adding progressive enhancements (static site generation, search, web interface) in future phases without breaking the core file-based approach.

### Context

Need to balance simplicity and accessibility with potential future enhancements. The core value lies in the organized documentation, but web presentation and search could significantly improve usability.

### Rationale

This approach preserves the investment in current content organization while allowing for future improvements. Users can always fall back to direct file access, ensuring the system remains robust and accessible regardless of technical enhancements.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Protects current investment in content organization
- Allows incremental improvement without risk
- Maintains multiple access methods (files, web, future options)
- Reduces technical risk of major platform changes

**Negative:**
- May result in some duplication of effort
- Requires maintaining compatibility across different access methods
- Could slow down implementation of advanced features
