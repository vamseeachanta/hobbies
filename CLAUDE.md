## Overview

Personal knowledge management system for organizing learning materials across multiple hobby areas (sports, gardening, software development, cultural activities) with integrated autism resources for family accessibility.

## Tech Stack

- Markdown documentation with file-based organization
- Git version control
- Future: Static site generation (Jekyll/Hugo)

## Project Structure

```
hobbies/
├── arts-music/     # Tuition and education materials

├── sdev/           # Software development learning
└── sports/         # Swimming, tennis, soccer, cycling
```

## Commands

```bash
# No build required - file-based documentation
ls -la                    # Browse categories
git status                # Track changes
```

## Project-Specific Rules
