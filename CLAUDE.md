# Hobbies — Agent Context

> Repo type: personal knowledge base (not a software project)
> No tests, no CI, no build tools required here.

## Repo Purpose

Family reference for gardening, sports, cultural activities, autism resources, and personal
development. All content is markdown or binary reference files (PDFs, images).

## Key Rules

1. Do not add software scaffolding, agent frameworks, or build tooling.
2. Do not run TDD or coverage workflows — there is no source code.
3. Every non-trivial change maps to a WRK-* item in workspace-hub work-queue.

## Docs

- `docs/repo-audit.md` — content inventory and scaffolding removal plan
- `docs/roadmap.md` — phased content goals and cleanup milestones
